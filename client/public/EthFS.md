# EthOS File System Browser

Please consume this demo responsibly:
* Do not delete files that you did not upload
* Delete all files/folders that you uploaded after you finish your experimentation

<content>

Each directory has a file associated with it (rather like the README.md file on GitHub), that decorates the contents. You are reading that file now for the current directory. So the contents are above and they are prefixed by some text and postfixed with this text. The text is in Markdown format.

## File Governance

The governance solution is in the works. So consensus on file management is not existent. But after it will exist, here will be described each public policy for the current directory.

## Intent

The intent of this directory/folder: showcase a proposed root directory for the Ethereum Operating System.

## Data Storage

For this demo, the on-chain data is on Ropsten. The files live on SWARM and the Web2 URLs.
